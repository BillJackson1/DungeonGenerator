# DungeonGenerator
An exercise in procedural generation

With this project, I'm trying to learn one way of creating procedural environments, in this case its a dungeon / level generator.
I hope to push it to a point where i can apply either pixel art for a top down style game, or 3D assets for 3rd person / first person style.
At this moment, the level generation algo is somewhat complete, I need to add more logic or modify the existing one to add walls and ceiling for 3D aspect, and then add the visuals and decorations.
